          <h1>Collaboration</h1>
          <p>Instructions:</p>
          <p>
            So in this project.. I'm looking to make super nerdy, cool programmer shirts. So today
            We're going to collaborate as a group to think of some ideas. On the shirt has to say something along
            the lines of "Frontend dev" or "Frontend Developers" and "ML/AI". Once we figure out as a group then we'll send
            over to Dan who can use his awesome illustrator magic to whip something up. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ask the question to the group.. 
            </li>
            <li>

              - weasel
              - cat with glasses
              - hamster
            </li>
            <li>
              What colors do you think? Should they pop and be loud or the opposite?

              # Neon Pink, just because...
              - hell yea

              # Dark blue? 

            </li>
            <li>
              What wording should we include?
              - "Frontend" on the front with an arrow pointing down to the crotch
              - "Backend" on the back with an arrow pointing down to the backend
              - "JavaScript fatigue is for mere mortals"
            </li>

          </ul>
